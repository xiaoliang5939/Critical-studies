This article raises important issues surrounding disability justice, accessibility, and inclusion, particularly in the context of industrial accidents like the Bhopal incident. The author rightly emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and the involvement of individuals with disabilities in the design and construction of accessible spaces and technology.

However, the article could benefit from more specific details and examples of how the proposed space station would address the needs of people with disabilities. While the general principles of accessibility and inclusivity are well-articulated, it is unclear how they would be put into practice in the station's design and operation.

Additionally, the article could have delved deeper into the systemic and structural factors that contribute to industrial accidents and the marginalization of people with disabilities. It would have been useful to examine the role of government regulations, corporate responsibility, and societal attitudes towards disability.

Overall, this article is a good starting point for a discussion on disability justice and accessibility. However, it would benefit from more specific examples and a deeper analysis of the systemic factors at play.
